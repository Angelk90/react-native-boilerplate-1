## The Architecture
The root file include the configuration of redux. The two important constants are `reducers` and `persistConfig`

```javascript
const reducers = combineReducers({
  startup,
  user,
})

const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage: AsyncStorage,
  whitelist: [],
}
```

 - `whitelist` includes state to persist
 - `reducers` includes all modules reducers

## Slices

A slice is a group of actions, states and reducers for a same module. For example, in the boilerplate there are two slices : `Startup` and `User`
in each slice there is a `index.js` file which combines each store's feature (`fetchOne.js` for the User slice) . We decide to separate each features in one file in order to avoid very big incomprehensible files.
So each feature includes its scoped state, actions and related reducers. 

```javascript
export default {
  initialState: {
    // Optionally, you can scope variables
    fetchOne: { loading: false, error: null },
  },
  action: buildAction('user/fetchOne', fetchOneUserService),
  reducers: buildReducers({
    errorKey: 'fetchOne.error', // Optionally, if you scoped variables, you can use a key with dot notation
    loadingKey: 'fetchOne.loading',
  }),
}
```

In the `index.js` file, all features are merged in a slice where states, actions, and reducers are merged and place in a slice.

```javascript
const moduleInitialState = {
  item: {},
}

export default buildSlice('user', [FetchOne], moduleInitialState).reducer
```

For the User example, the below state will be create :
```
{
  user: {
    item: {},
    fetchOne: {
      loading: false,
      error: null,
    }   
 }
}
```
The actions will be : `user/fetchOne/pending`, `user/fetchOne/fulfilled`, `user/fetchOne/ejected`
For each action, a reducer is associated.

## Redux-toolkit-wrapper
The boilerplate includes a wrapper of redux-toolkit to make it easier to use. It provides three helpers.
If your are not familiar with redux-toolkit, please have a look at their [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore).

### buildAction
`buildAction` is a wrapper of [`createAsyncThunk`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk).

|       Parameters      |      Description                            |   Type    |   Default  |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------- | :--------- |
| actionName            | the name of the action                      | string    | undefined  |
| action                | function to launch and await                | function  | () => {}   |

### buildReducers
`buildReducers` create default reducers based on CRUD logic. It creates tree functions : pending, fulfilled and rejected.
- pending set the loadingKey to true and the errorKey to null.
- fulfilled replaces itemKey with the payload (if itemKey is not null)
- pending set the loadingKey to false and the errorKey to payload.


|   Parameters   |      Description               |   Type    |   Default |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| itemKey        | the key of the item state      | string    | 'item'    |
| loadingKey     | the key of the loading state   | string    | 'loading' |
| errorKey       | the key of the error state     | string    | 'error'   |

### buildSlice
`buildSlice` is a wrapper of [`createSlice`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice).


|       Parameters      |      Description                              |   Type    |   Default |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| name                  | the name of the slice                         | string    | undefined |
| modules               | array of all modules                          | array     | undefined |
| moduleInitialState    | initial state for all modules of the slice    | object    | {}        |
